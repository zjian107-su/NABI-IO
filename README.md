## **Change Log**

This section aims to keep notes on daily improvements and detail changes.

- 0527: Initiate the web dev.
  - Starting as "Hello World" and then improving while learning on "Gatsby Tutorial and Projects Course".
  - added two RCC(react class component) of /home_page and /intro
- 0528:

  - Adding [emojis](https://medium.com/@seanmcp/%EF%B8%8F-how-to-use-emojis-in-react-d23bbf608bf7) into the structure. The first way, using
    `<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">üêë</span>`. The second way is using a component, such as:

    ```javascript
    import React from "react";
    const Emoji = (props) => (
      <span
        className="emoji"
        role="img"
        aria-label={props.label ? props.label : ""}
        aria-hidden={props.label ? "false" : "true"}
      >
        {props.symbol}
      </span>
    );
    export default Emoji;
    ```

    You may use the Emoji component as `<Emoji symbol="üêë" label="sheep"/>`

  - Improving `<Layout>` by adding footer and navbar
  - Learned that style component's usage is just like graphql search. They both use backtsick.
  - StaticQuery hook from Graphiql IDE Code Exporter can help extract info by editing codes after `return`. But you can also using `import {useStaticQuery, graphql} from 'gatsby'` - creating the **first object** after fetching info using graphql, then create the **second object** passing the object to useStaticQuery(). So later you can use the second object as json format to search info.
