## üìù **Change Log**

This section aims to keep notes on daily improvements and detail changes.

- 0527: Initiated the web development
  - Started as a simple "Hello World" website and then improved it while learning on "Gatsby Tutorial and Projects Course".
  - added two RCC(react class component) of /home_page and /intro
- 0528: Emoji, Layout, GraphQL, useStaticQuery, StaticQuery, pageQuery, Markdown, MDX
  - Added [emojis](https://medium.com/@seanmcp/%EF%B8%8F-how-to-use-emojis-in-react-d23bbf608bf7) into the structure. The **first** method, using
    `<span role='img' aria-label='sheep'>üêë</span>`. The **second** method is using a component, such as:

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react'
    const Emoji = props => (
      <span
        className="emoji"
        role="img"
        aria-label={props.label ? props.label : ""}
        aria-hidden={props.label ? "false" : "true"}
      >
        {props.symbol}
      </span>
    )
    export default Emoji
    ```

    You may use the Emoji component as `<Emoji symbol="üêë" label="sheep"/>`

  - Improved `<Layout>` by adding a footer and a nav bar
  - Learned that style component's usage is just like GraphQL search. They both use backtick.
  - StaticQuery hook from GraphQL IDE Code Exporter can help extract info by editing codes after `return`. But you can also use `import {useStaticQuery, graphql} from 'gatsby'` - creating the **first object** after fetching info using GraphQL, then create the **second object** passing the object to useStaticQuery(). So later you can use the second object as json format to search info.

- 0529: Improved Markdown syntax for logo creation
- 0531: Performed `npm install --save-dev xxxxx` to fix dev dependency issues
  - Gatsby image operation
- 0601 -> 0605: learned and tested `gatsby -imagesharp`, `gatsby-image` and `gatsby-markdown-transformer` plugins
  - useStaticQuery(Code Explorer: StaticQuery Hook), import `**useStaticQuery**`: the useStaticQuery() function can only fun in the functional component. But you can pass the query that is outside of the function.
  - StaticQuery(Code Explorer: StaticQuery), import **StaticQuery**: you will use `<StaticQuery>` as a component in your codes. It has TWO props, `` query={graphql`BLOCK`} `` and `render={data} => <div><dive>`
  - pageQuery(Code Explorer: Page Query), import only GraphQL. It has to be in a page directory, not anywhere else. You have to pass a prop parameter. But in the console you will see a lot of props but no data, so you need to export dataQuery too.
  - Created a photo gallery page to show Nabi's pictures
  - Created a page that's generated with NodeAPI and a markdown file with its Layout CSS.
- 0606 -> 0607
  - MDX = JSX + Markdown. JSX is not the best for content, Markdown is not the best for operations. Therefore, MDX with theme might be the better option
  - Migrated packages from using npm to yarn. Yarn is lightly faster and I prefer how clean yarn is. [Getting Started with Gatsby Themes and MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-02-26-getting-started-with-gatsby-themes/)
- 0608
  - to see pages that are created by plugin or codes

      allSitePage {
        edges {
          node {
            path
            component
            pluginCreator {
              name
              pluginFilepath
            }
          }
        }
