## üìù **Change Log**

This section aims to keep notes on daily improvements and detail changes.

- 0527: Initiate the web dev.
  - Starting as "Hello World" and then improving while learning on "Gatsby Tutorial and Projects Course".
  - added two RCC(react class component) of /home_page and /intro
- 0528: Emoji, Layout, grpahQL, userStaticQuery

  - Adding [emojis](https://medium.com/@seanmcp/%EF%B8%8F-how-to-use-emojis-in-react-d23bbf608bf7) into the structure. The **first** method, using
    `<span role="img" aria-label="sheep">üêë</span>`. The **second** method is using a component, such as:

    ```javascript
    import React from "react"
    const Emoji = props => (
      <span
        className="emoji"
        role="img"
        aria-label={props.label ? props.label : ""}
        aria-hidden={props.label ? "false" : "true"}
      >
        {props.symbol}
      </span>
    )
    export default Emoji
    ```

    You may use the Emoji component as `<Emoji symbol="üêë" label="sheep"/>`

  - Improving `<Layout>` by adding footer and navbar
  - Learned that style component's usage is just like graphql search. They both use backtsick.
  - StaticQuery hook from Graphiql IDE Code Exporter can help extract info by editing codes after `return`. But you can also using `import {useStaticQuery, graphql} from 'gatsby'` - creating the **first object** after fetching info using graphql, then create the **second object** passing the object to useStaticQuery(). So later you can use the second object as json format to search info.

- 0529: Markdown syntax improve, logo creation
- 0531: `npm install --save-dev xxxxx` for fixing dev dependencies issues
  - gatsby image operation
- 0601 -> 0605: learn and test gatsby -imagesharp, gatsby-image and gatsby-markdown-transformer plugins.
  - useStaticQuery(Code Explorer: StaticQuery Hook), import **useStaticQuery**: the useStaticQuery() function can only fun in the functional component. But you can pass the query that is outside of the function.
  - StaticQuery(Code Explorer: StaticQuery), import **StaticQuery**: you will use `<StaticQuery>` as a component in your codes. It has TWO props, `` query={graphql`BLOCK`} `` and `render={data} => <div><dive>`
  - pageQuery(Code Explorerm: Page Query), import only graphql. It has to be in a page directory, not anywhere else. You have to pass a prop parameter. But in the console you will see a lot of props but no data, so you need to export dataQuery too.
  - Created a photo gallery page to show Nabi's pictures
  - Created a page that's generated with NodeAPI and a markdownfile with its Layout CSS.
- 0606 -> 0607
  - MDX = JSX + Markdown. JSX is not the best for content, Markdown is not the best for operatins. So MDX with theme, might be the better option
  - Changed all npms to yarn. Yarn vs NPM5. Very smiliar compare to "yarn vs npm3". But yarn is lightly faster and I prefer how clean yarn is. [Getting Started with Gatsby Themes and MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-02-26-getting-started-with-gatsby-themes/)
- 0608
